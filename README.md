# Music Player Server

This is the server for a local music player. It is a work in progress and subject to rapid changes. For now, support is limited to .mp3 files.

# Setup

In the project directory:

```BASH
yarn install
mkdir testMusic
```

Add mp3 files of your choice to the `testMusic` directory.

# Testing

Tests are run via `jest` with `yarn test`
